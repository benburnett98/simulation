Biggest change: 

I want to remove the Tile class, which stores the location of the rectangle item in x and y,
completely. I think that the backend should manage cell locations, and I (the front end) just display things over and over.
We also want to make an interface for handling inputs and a pagefactory. 

We also talked about how we would implement the Grid class that Prof Duvall
talked about in class, which would just affect the backend and then how the 
front end receives its variables. Not a big deal but just needs to know how to
implement things.

We also talked about the inheritance hierarchy in the backend. 

We were all in class today but all of our work was really catching each other up on what
we were doing and asking Prof Duvall questions.
